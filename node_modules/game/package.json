  "readme": "\nThis is a game that I started to build many years ago.\nBefore Node.js existed.\n\nThe idea was an http 'server' written in javascript,\nwith the logic on the server side.\nThe server presented pages to the browser,\nprocessed the results of the user's chosen action,\nand then returned a new page with the results.\n\nThe game itself was basically a Zork-style text adventure.\n\nThe original game was built using the JS engine from Mozilla.\nI compiled the engine and provide a couple of native functions\nso that the JS could consume input and emit output and the\nrest was done inside the JS context.\n\nIt was cool, but I never pursued it.\n\nI dug it out recently, and spent about 1 hour converting it to\nuse Node.js instead of the Mozilla engine.\n\n\n",
